[In development]

The project has its origins in a forum dedicated to online role-playing games, where players and game masters meet to organize games. However, the forum presents major problems such as a lack of visibility for new announcements, the absence of a filtering and sorting system, and difficulty in retrieving player information. To solve these problems, the aim of the project is to create a web application offering several functionalities :
- Highlight new game announcements for greater visibility.
- Make it easier for players to find and apply for games.
- Allow players to manage the games they play.
- Offer a private messaging system for communication between players.
- Facilitate communication and interaction between players through game-related conversations.
- Set up an administration system to manage users, games, announcements and site security.
- Send notifications to players to inform them of updates and new announcements.

The technologies used to develop this application include C#, ASP.NET Core 7, Entity Framework Core 7 for database access, Microsoft SQL Server 2022 as the database management system, ASP.NET Core Identity for authentication and authorization management, Visual Studio 2022 as the development environment, the library Bootstrap 5.4 for front-end development
